Suppose you have a collection of students of the following form
{
	_id  ObjectId(50c598f582094fb5f92efb96),
	first_name  John,
	last_name  Doe,
	date_of_admission  ISODate(2010-02-21T050000Z),
	residence_hall  Fairweather,
	has_car  true,
	student_id  2348023902,
	current_classes  [
		His343,
		Math234,
		Phy123,
		Art232
	]
}

Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last name, first name and student_id, are too slow (we can't do enough of them per second from our program). What could potentially improve the speed of inserts. Check all that apply.

KO->Add an index on last_name, first_name if one does not already exist.
OK->Remove all indexes from the collection
KO->Provide a hint to MongoDB that it should not use an index for the inserts
OK->Set w=0, j=0 on writes
KO->Build a replica set and insert data into the secondary nodes to free up the primary nodes.
