Let's suppose you have a five member replica set and want to assure that writes are committed to the journal and are acknowledged by at least 3 nodes before you proceed forward. What would be the appropriate settings for w and j?

KO->w=1, j=1
OK->w="majority", j=1
KO->w=3, j=0
KO->w=5, j=1
KO->w=1,j=3
